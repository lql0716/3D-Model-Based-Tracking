# 3D-Model-Based-Tracking
This practical aims to track an object, in images acquired by a camera, and to simultaneously estimate its pose, knowing a 3D model of it. The tools that are going to be used are a digital camera, for the hardware, and the C++ language, CMake and ViSP library for the software side.
